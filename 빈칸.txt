Explorers will tell you that in an [extreme wilderness] such as the Arctic Ocean, one of the [least explored places] on Earth, your life is in danger from the moment you arrive. After that it’s only a matter of [how much danger you are in]. This was the case for Borge Ousland, a Norwegian, and Mike Horn, a South African-born Swiss. The two explorers landed on Cape Arkticheskiy, in Siberia, in the [pitch] dark of polar winter, in 2006. Their mission was to [navigate] their way across the 600 miles (965 kilometers) to the North Pole, and to do so unsupported-no dogsleds or airdrops of equipment, no food or fuel along the way. As they skied their way to their [destination], they pulled sleds that carried everything [they might need]. On the first night in their tent, Borge heard something. “Mike, is that you?”  “Yeah, I’m chewing on a piece of chocolate.” 
Then came a [ripping sound]-fwaap!-followed by the head of a polar bear. Mike and Borge quickly moved backward. This scared the bear, and it [ran off] with some food.  They chased after it, [firing the flare gun], to get the food back. Each bit of food was necessary, [indispensable], in fact. When it came time for bed, Borge was nervous, but Mike assured him [that he was alert] and ready for anything; he knew all the sounds. Then he immediately [fell fast asleep] and started snoring. Borge, however, was wide awake. “Mike, how can you sleep?” “Borge, if you warry, you die. If you don’t worry, you also die. So, why worry?”
The next night, the tent was flapping so noisily in the wind that [they didn’t hear] a polar bear taking away their rubber boat. They found it the next morning, 100 yards (91 meters) away, chewed up, and they had to spend hours repairing it. Two nights, two bears. After repairing the boat, Borge and Mike took a walk to see [whether the ice was stable enough to travel over]. For the duration of their expedition, the men checked in with Hans Ambohl in Switzerland, who relayed information about [weather conditions]. Based on the [satellite] images provided by the Canadian Space Agency, the ice [appeared to be drifting quickly] to the southeast-the wrong way-at a rate of half a mile (0.8 kilometers) an hour. 
Nevertheless, the two men [were tired of] polar bears. So, [as soon as] the ice drift calmed down, they took their [chances] and left. Borge and Mike had to use the repaired rubber boat to cross the treacherous water, and they [camped for the night] on a small patch of ice, only a couple of miles away from [where] they had first started. When they woke up, they found the ice floe had carried them 9 miles (14 kilometers) backward. That’s [how things went] for the next couple of weeks, with everything around them [opposite from] what it was supposed to be. [Instead] of frigid weather, there was a Siberian heat wave-temperatures in the teens and twenties. Yet, [rather than] minimal wind, there was a harsh gale, blowing the wrong way and in their faces. 
And, finally, [as opposed] to the ice drifting in a direction that would help them, the floes carried them away from the Pole. Day after day, they’d march north, then slip back toward Siberia while they slept; it was all they could do to [hold their position]. There were only [a limited number of weeks] before the midnight sun would rise over the horizon and begin six months of [continuous] light to the region. The plan was to get to the North Pole before [that]. They worried that they’d never make it at this rate, and they would [run out of] food. So they started walking longer and eating less and, consequently, having [distracting food fantasies]: blueberry crepes with sour cream for Borge and chocolate-covered marshmallows for Mike. 

Sometimes it was all they could do to keep their eyes focused on the ends of their skis and move forward for the next hour, the next minute, the next yard (meter), because [it wouldn’t do any good to think ahead]. It was that [rarest] of experiences-living completely in the now.  Where am I? What must I do? Can I still feel my fingers? Sometimes they were happy just to find themselves [alive] in the tent at the end of the day. When the two men finally reached their destination, they were utterly [exhausted], had frostbite, but were still in one piece.

What they had accomplished stands as one of the most daring polar expeditions in recent memory: [Setting out] in total darkness and surviving [physically] and [mentally]. That had been the essence of the trip. Reaching the Pole was a necessary, but almost [irrelevant conclusion]. Why would they have put themselves in this position? This was, actually, exactly what they had wanted. Both men had been adventuring since boyhood, taking increasingly higher and higher calculated risks. At some point, they left their [comfort zones] and never went back. For them, going to extremes that may seem [insane] was actually a [logical progression].

They discovered that they could earn a living-writing books, taking pictures, making films, and presenting motivational speeches. Now, they have [sponsors]: outdoor gear manufacturers, construction outfits, and adventure travel agency, a watch company. Extreme adventure is their [livelihood]. Some people say that the two men have a [death wish], but this just seems to amuse Mike and Borge. They will tell you that it isn’t a desire to be [closer to death] that attracts them; it’s a desire to be closer to [life]. They’ve been to the [mountaintop]. They know that [willpower] can be built, that ordinary people, like themselves, have abilities beyond their wildest dreams.

They’re just the ones who are out there, scouting the wilderness on behalf of the rest of us. They aren’t marking dots on a [geographical map] anymore. That was accomplished long ago. What they are doing now is [exploring the inner map], the mental and emotional map. What will they learn about themselves from being in a position where [nothing matters except staying alive]? What, exactly, is the human being [capable of]? This is what drives them.
