Success at work-and in life more generally — [is/are] something that every generation [strives for/strive]. But what we mean by success and how we measure it can vary greatly. Over time societal norms and expectations [change and evolve/are changed and evolved]. People working in human resource management [take/takes] a keen interest in these changes as they attempt to manage and motivate the workforce of the present and prepare the ground for the workforce of the future. One approach they have adopted [is/are] [building/built] profiles of different generations that help them to analyze their attitudes and motivations. Although there is some debate about where each generation [starts and ends/start and end], the main three categories are broadly [defined/defining] as follows. 



This group came typically from stable family backgrounds with stay-at-home mums. Although their parents on the whole had conservative attitudes, they were brought up in a time of great social and economic change(the 1960s), a period [when/which] youth was [celebrated/celebrating] and traditional ways of doing things were being [challenged/challenging]. As a result, they tended to grow up [questioning/questioned] authority. They are an optimistic generation and with some justification - economic opportunities were good for [them/those] and for [those/them] with a university education, financial success, or at least comfort, was more or less [guaranteed/guaranteeing]. At work they put in long hours and strove to be experts in their fields, because they measure success by [how/what] good they are at [what/how] they do. In a similar way, outside work they aspired to self-exploration and personal growth. 







This generation, much smaller in number than [that/those] [which/what] preceded or succeeded it, is also known as the ‘lost generation’. Perhaps this is because the world of their childhood was rather [less/more] clearly defined and more uncertain: global problems like AIDS and the energy crisis came to the fore; families were smaller, but children spend less time with their parents; people also seemed more cynical about progress. Accordingly, Generation X felt they had to rely on [themselves/them] to succeed and so a more pragmatic approach to life [emerged/emerging], with an emphasis on a career education. It is fair to say this group [were/was] less happy-go-lucky than the baby boomers, more [focused/focusing] on hard work and its traditional reward-money. In turn, this(monetary) definition of success gave rise to greater peer pressure to [conform/conforming] and ‘grow up’ more quickly.  



Generation Y are as numerous as baby boomers. The age they were born into [is/are] [characterized/characterizing] firstly by its strong and [sustained/sustaining], economic growth and secondly by the development of the Internet and digital technologies, an age where everything is available on demand. It’s also important to note the attitude of their parents, the baby boomers. They adopted a much more consultative approach to [parenting/parent] than the previous generation, [allowing/allows] their children to negotiate their own educational options and [encouraging/encourage] them [to discuss/discussing] issues in and outside the home. The result is more outward-looking generation and one [which/who] believes in negotiation and collaboration. The downside, perhaps, is that they have high expectations and often demand instant gratification. 








[Seeing/Seen] their parents work long hours, they want a more [balanced/balancing] life and put a premium on free time rather than money or their rank in an organization’s hierarchy. They are keen to [develop/developing] in creative areas and the [increased/increasing] connectivity of the Internet world [affords/afford] them ready access to a like-minded and appreciative audience. In this context, success can be [measured/measure] on a smaller scale — something as [simple/simply] as someone liking a post on your social network page. Millennial also tend to view success in terms of their contribution to the community – they expect the companies they work for and the projects they work on to be ethical, socially inclusive and to answer real needs in society.
